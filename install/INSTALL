In order to use the benchmark platform you need to install all the software related 
to the DBs/solutions you want to use.

See the instructions of these ones in different OSs in the sub-folders in this folder.

In addition to install the current project, i.e. the benchmark platform you also need:

# CentOS
yum install python-devel freetype freetype-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel libpng-devel python-pip python-psycopg2 python-matplotlib

pip install --upgrade setuptools
# This may give problems, in that case install from:
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python

#Requirements:
pip install lxml
pip install psutil
pip install numpy --upgrade 

The directory with this code must be added to the PYTHONPATH
