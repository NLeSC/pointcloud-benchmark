This instructions are to install in a CentOS 6 system the following software:
liblas, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PointCloud for PostgreSQL, LAStools, MonetDB and Oracle

Some of these tools require custom builds of the software. 
We choose to install all the required software in /opt/sw

All the installed software must be added to PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, C_PATH and PYTHONPATH

For that we use a file in /opt/sw/export_paths.sh where all modification to environmental variables must be done 

Do:
touch /opt/sw/export_custom.sh
echo "source /opt/sw/export_custom.sh" > /etc/profile.d/custom.sh

To guarantee that all installed software is available for all users
