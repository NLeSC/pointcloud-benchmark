# Binaries will be found in the 'bin' directory. 
# Recommended not to run 'make install' because most of lastools' executables have the same names as the liblas utilities. 

### We need Wine to run windows executables (most of lastools are only windows compiled)
#(it requires EPEL: yum install http://mirror.its.dal.ca/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm )
# Check that the main repository is enabled in /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo (should say enabled=1 under the first, base package).
sudo yum install wine
cd bin
chmod +x *.exe

# Add paths to export_paths.sh

# Note that LAStools requires DB help when having many files so the installation of PostgreSQL and PostGIS must also be done (point cloud extension not required)
