NLeSC LAS to DB tools

libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common `LAS`
`LiDAR`_ format. The `ASPRS LAS format`_ is a sequential binary format used to
store data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing software for data
interchange and archival. 

lasnlesc converts LAS files, or its compressed format LAZ, into the binary
formats used by MonetDB and Postgres.

For MonetDB use las2col, while for Postgres use las2pg
Before running any of the commands do:
. config/lasNLeSC_config.sh
