NLeSC LAS to DB tools

libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common `LAS`
`LiDAR`_ format. The `ASPRS LAS format`_ is a sequential binary format used to
store data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing software for data
interchange and archival. 

lasnlesc converts LAS files, or its compressed format LAZ, into the binary
formats used by MonetDB and Postgres.

For MonetDB use las2col, while for Postgres use las2pg
See INSTALL to find out how to install this apps

They loaders (las2col and las2pg) generate dump files as used by those two DBs 
that can be then imported into the DBs producing a table with one point per row.

MONETDB example
###############
# Use binary loader to create the columnar files
# /pak1/mondata/tmp/0_listFile is the list of LAS/LAZ files
las2col -f /pak1/mondata/tmp/0_listFile /pak1/mondata/tmp/0_tempFile --parse xyz
# las2col is using multiple cores

# Use mclient or your favorite language API to import data in DB:
COPY BINARY INTO ahn_flat from ('/pak1/mondata/tmp/0_tempFile_col_x.dat','/pak1/mondata/tmp/0_tempFile_col_y.dat','/pak1/mondata/tmp/0_tempFile_col_z.dat')
# Note the table receiving the data must have been previously created


POSTGRESQL EXAMPLE
##################
# In this case we can use a pipe to directly import the LAS file into a postgresql table
las2pg -s tile_85800_447300.las --stdout --parse xyz | psql  pf20Mxyz -c "copy ahn_flat from stdin with binary"
# Note the table receiving the data must have been previously created
# las2pg uses one single core but you can have multiple instances of it importing data simultanoeulsy

# MORTON CODES
Both loaders can generate morton codes (codification of XY -> position of the point in the Morton SFC)
The code to decode the generated morton codes can be found in src/decode_morton.c
This can be used in cases where we only store the Morton code (and not the XY) and we use use the code to decode XY when necessary
The Morton code can be used, in addition to order points, to do queries. In that case use the code in sfcnlesc
